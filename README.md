# NFSU2 Unlimiter
NFSU2 Unlimiter is a script mod which fixes some issues and makes some improvements for added cars and events.

Features:
+ Fixes visibility and crash issues for added cars.
+ Fixes disappearing wheels issue.
+ Expands memory pools.
+ Fixes a crash issue related with world map markers.
+ Adds options to change car render information. (See UnlimiterData\_General.ini file.)
	- LinkLicensePlateToTrunk: Attaches license plate to trunk for part animations.
	- ShowTrunkUnderInFE: Shows inside of the trunk while in menus.
	- RemoveCentreBrakeWithCustomSpoiler: Removes centre brakelight position marker when a custom spoiler is installed.
	- HasSunroof: Swaps KIT00_ROOF with KIT00_FULLROOF when a roof scoop is installed.
+ Fixes missing objects for options and stuff in FNGs by cloning them.
+ Allows the events to have specific engage messages in any stage. (The game did it only for Stage 0 by default.)
+ Adds new customization items to the menu. (Fully configurable via car-specific or general ini files.) (Parts should get added by modders.)
+ Restores cut customization options from the game: Trunk Audio Paint, Cabin Neon, Hood Decals, etc.
+ Lets modders add custom rim brands. (Fully configurable via ini file.)
+ Adds custom attributes to allow even more customization options: (Extra Customization needs to be enabled to make custom attributes work.)
    - SHOWENGINE (Boolean) : Allows the player to see engine and neon through the hood.
    - SHOWTRUNK (Boolean) : Allows the player to see trunk audio components and neon through the trunk.
    - TRUNKUNDER (Key) : Sets the under part of the trunk. Works like the HOODUNDER attribute, which is available for hoods.
	- NUMSLOTS (Integer) : Declares the number of component slots a Trunk Audio Layout has. If not present, the "default" hardcoded values from the game will be used.
	- FRONT_TIRE_OFFSET (Floating) : Adds offset (spacers) to the front wheels. This attribute can be added to Fender and Wide Body parts.
	- REAR_TIRE_OFFSET (Floating) : Adds offset (spacers) to the rear wheels. This attribute can be added to Quarter Panel and Wide Body parts.
